You add data to Elasticsearch as JSON objects called documents. Elasticsearch stores these documents in searchable indices.

For time series data, such as logs and metrics, you typically add documents to a data stream made up of multiple auto-generated backing indices.

A data stream requires an index template that matches its name. Elasticsearch uses this template to configure the streamâ€™s backing indices. Documents sent to a data stream must have a @timestamp field.
