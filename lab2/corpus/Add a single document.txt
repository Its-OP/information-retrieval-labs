Submit the following indexing request to add a single log entry to the logs-my_app-default data stream. Since logs-my_app-default doesnâ€™t exist, the request automatically creates it using the built-in logs-*-* index template. The response includes metadata that Elasticsearch generates for the document:
The backing _index that contains the document. Elasticsearch automatically generates the names of backing indices.
A unique _id for the document within the index.
